# How to start
This template requires you to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To start you will need to clone the repository:
Open a terminal in your folder of choice and use:
</br>
	`$ git clone https://github.com/Kewyn-Vieira/website-template`
</br>

Choose the template type you will use and follow its instructions

## HTML
Open a terminal in the root folder and use:
</br>
	`$ git rebase origin/HTML`
</br>

This command will install HTML to your template. The HTML template comes with Javascript and CSS by default.
Before installing add-ons you should read [Add-ons](#add-ons)?

### Install Sass
Open a terminal in the root folder and use:
</br>
	`$ git merge origin/Sass`
</br>

### Install Typescript

</br>
	`$ git merge origin/Typescript -X rename-threshold=25`
</br>

## Handlebars
Open a terminal in the root folder and use:
</br>
	`$ git rebase origin/Handlebars`
</br>

This command will install Handlebars to your template. The Handlebars template comes with Javascript and CSS by default.

# Add-ons
The installation of the add-ons are obviously optional. Every template comes with CSS and Javascript by default. If you don't want any other add-ons, jump to [How to start developing](#start-developing).

If you wish to install add-ons you should first open a terminal in the root folder and install [`npm-merge-driver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-merge-driver) to prevent merge conflicts between `package-lock.json` files, to accomplish this simply use:
</br>
	`$ npx npm-merge-driver install`
</br>
